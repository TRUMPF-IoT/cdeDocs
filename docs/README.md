# C-DEngine Documentation

Thank you for your interest in the C-DEngine – the rapid development framework for IoT solutions.

With the C-DEngine (pronounced “seed engine”), you can develop distributed solutions connecting local on-premise devices with enterprise and cloud services.

The C-DEngine can automatically generate a modern Natural Machine Interface (NMI) that is compatible with any HTML5-enabled browser running on mobile devices such as tablets, pads, smart phones, and desktop browsers. The NMI automatically provides a combined view of the user interfaces for all the "Things" on each of the nodes in the distributed solution (we call it a "Mesh" of relay nodes).

This depot contains the current documentation of the C-DEngine. We are constantly working on new documents.
