Configuration Keys for C-DEngine.dll Version Number 1.1 (Draft) February 3rd, 2020

Introduction to Configuration Keys
==================================

Overview
--------

Configuration settings are using “Key/Value” pairs. This document describes the
effect of values to their corresponding keys.

App.Config
----------

Local configuration file of an application hosting the C-DEngine.

cdeTPI – C-DEngine Provisioning Info
------------------------------------

Encrypted store with all settings changed by the NMI or auto-created by the
C-DEngine. The file can be pushed from the C-DEngine Provisining Service.

The Settings API (ICDESettings)
-------------------------------

Configuration Keys Reference
============================

The C-DEngine differentiates between four different setting stages:

1.  First Boot Only – parsed only when the node is started for the very first
    time (boot). For example if no cache folder exists or no cdeTPI exists
2.  Startup Only – parsed every time the node starts up
3.  Anytime at Runtime – These are settings that might be read and parsed
    multiple times during runtime and can be changed via the Provisioning
    service on the fly without restarting the node. Most of the CDE settings
    fall in the category
4.  Plugin only settings – plugins can add settings, either before the start of
    the node via the app.config or even store settings to the cdeTPI secure
    storage. This document will not cover these settings as they are plugin
    specific

There is one important setting that will render a node “Read-Only” and does
prevent any setting from being written to the cdeTPI store:

```UseRandomDeviceID=true```

If set to true, the node will never write anything to disk including settings.
All relevant settings have to be in the app.config and cdeTPI will be ignored.

-   The default value of all Boolean keys is “false”.
-   The default value of all string keys is “not Set”
-   The default value of all Guid Keys is “Guid.Empty”
-   String List use values separated with ; if not other specified

If ```AllowEnvironmentVars=true``` and ```AllowEnvironmentVarsToOverrideConfig=true```
then ANY setting can be overwritten with environment variables. No matter if
they are declared in the app.config or in the cdeTPI. Please use with caution as
these values are globally visible on the hosting PC and cannot be managed by the
C-DEngine. All Environment variable have to start with “CDE_” and always use
upper case (i.e. the setting for the “ServiceRoute” would be “CDE_SERVICEROUTE”)

First Boot only settings
------------------------

First boot settings are only parsed when the node is started for the very first
time (No cache folder existed – no cdeTPI existed).

These setting are important for subsequent starts of the node. If these settings
are in the app.config, they will be transferred to the secure cdeTPI storage and
then no longer parsed from app.config (in subsequent node starts).

| **Configuration Key** | **Type**    | **stored in cdeTPI**       | **Description**                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |

| MyDeviceInfo          | struct      | Always during first boot\* | Contains important information about the hardware/os and the DeviceID of the node. The DeviceID is a unique Identifier for the node. There must not be duplicates of DeviceIDs in a mesh solution. This setting is automatically created during boot of the node and cannot directly be set.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| PresetDeviceID        | Guid        | Always during first boot\* | If set, the DeviceID in MyDeviceInfo will use this Guid instead of calculating a new Guid during first boot                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| IsUsingUserMapper     | bool        | Always during first boot\* | This setting cannot be changed after the first boot. If true, the C-DEngine will initialize the User Manager and once initialized the User Manager cannot be turned off anymore. If the setting is false, the node only allows Scope Access in the NMI. This is the default for “communication only nodes”.                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| Coufs                 | JSON string | Not stored                 | Contains a structure that “Creates user on first startup”. Can be used by MSI setups and App.Config to automatically create an admin user during the first boot. The key is removed from the app.config an ignored during subsequent starts of the node.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| EasyScope             | String      | Stored as ScrambledScope   | A node can be configured with a specific scope during first boot. The C-DEngine will delete this setting from the app.config after it has been read.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| DontDeleteEasyScope   | Bool        | Not stored                 | If true, the EasyScope will not be deleted from the app.config (Docker scenario)                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| DontVerifyTrust       | Bool        | Always during first boot\* | If set to true, the node is starting without validating the Plugins code signing certificates. A node cannot toggle between trust and no trust. If trust is turned off one time, it remains untrusted until the node is “wiped clean” again. Default value (FALSE) requires all plugins to be signed with the same certificate as the host application or C-DEngine.DLL. When TRUE, no signing is required (not recommended for production sites), as the C-DEngine is running in "Unsafe" mode and custom plugins can be installed. |

\* If UseRandomDeviceID=true, the setting is not written to the cdeTPI

All other settings
------------------

In general, if a setting is in the cdeTPI it will override the setting in
app.config. This allows to set a default setting in app.config but the NMI UX
can override and store the setting. Then the setting in app.config is no longer
valid. A good example for this is the “CloudRoute”. It can be set in the
app.config as a default route but admin users with NMI access can change the
CloudRoute which will then be stored in the cdeTPI. If a setting is defined in
app.config and cdeTPI, the value in cdeTPI will be used.

Many settings are not copied in the cdeTPI file and just reside in the
App.config. The Provisioning service can write any setting and override anything
that is in the app.config. Without a provisioning service present, only those
settings marked “stored in cdeTPI” will be copied to the cdeTPI secure store.

Some settings will be removed (deleted) from the app.config after they were read
for the first time. An example of this are the proxy settings or the EasyScope.

-   If set to 0 or does not exist, a client certificate is not used and not required (default mode of previous CDE versions) 
-   If Set to 1, client can present a client certificate. If no scopes are in
    the cert, scopes will be used as before (Mix operation between new and old
    security mode)
-   If Set to 2, client must present a valid client certificate. If no scopes
    are in the cert, scopes will be used as before (was previous
    "RequireClientCertificate=true") (previous default mode but with Client
    Certificate turned on)
-   If set to 3, all clients (including NMI browsers) need to present a client
    certificate (new enforced Client Certificate Mode only - older CDE Nodes
    will not able to connect)
-   If the client certificate contains one or more SAN URLs of the scheme
    "com.c-labs.cdescope://" the client will only participate in scopes with
    that scopeID. The first cdescope is used as the ScopeID if no scope is
    presented in the message or connection
-   In IIS, settings 2 and 3 require the "Client Certificates" setting in "SSL
    Settings" to be set as "Accept" or "Require" for NMI access
