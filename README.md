# C-DEngine Documentation

This repository contains the C-DEngine conceptual and "Getting Started" documentation.

+ Recommended site for reading: http://docs.c-labs.com, or you can view them [here](docs/README.md) in the GitHub context.
+ Reference documentation of the C-DEngine API can be found at http://www.C-Labs.com/docu (and of course in the assemblies themselves for use with Intellisense etc.).
+ Samples, Visual Studio Templates and Convenience Libraries can be found in the C-DESDK Depot https://github.com/TRUMPF-IoT/C-DESDK.

Contributions to the documentation are welcome (through pull request in this repository), just like for the source repos.
